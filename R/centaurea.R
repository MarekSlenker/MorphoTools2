#' 25 morphological characters of three species of the \emph{Centaurea phrygia} complex
#'
#' The sample data include portions of data sets from previously published studies by Koutecký (2007) and Koutecký et al. (2012):
#' 25 morphological characters (see the cited studies for details) of the vegetative (stems and leaves) and reproductive structures
#' (capitula and achenes) of three diploid species of the \emph{Centaurea phrygia} complex: \emph{C. phrygia} L. s.str. (abbreviated "ph"),
#' \emph{C. pseudophrygia} C.A.Mey. ("ps") and \emph{C. stenolepis} A.Kern. ("st"). Moreover, a fourth group includes the putative hybrid
#' \emph{C. pseudophrygia} × \emph{C. stenolepis} ("hybr"). The data represent 8, 12, 7 and 6 populations for
#' each group, respectively, and 20 individuals per population, with one exception in which only 12
#' individuals were available. All morphological characters are either quantitative (direct measurements,
#' counts or ratios) or binary (two characters states or presence/absence). In four characters, there are missing data because they were not available
#'  in all individuals. In two populations of \emph{C. stenolepis} these characters were completely missing. In total, the data set includes 652 individuals (453
#'  complete) from 33 populations (31 complete).
