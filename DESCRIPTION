Description: This package includes tools for multivariate analyses of morphological data. Commonly used tools are missing or scattered across several R packages. The 'MorphoTools2' package, in order to make the workflow convenient and fast, wraps statistical and graphical tools and provides a comprehensive framework for checking and manipulating input data, statistical analyses and visualisation of results.
  Several methods are provided for the analysis of raw data, to make the dataset ready for downstream analyses. Integrated statistical methods can be divided into those used for generating hypotheses (hierarchical classification, principal component analysis, principal coordinates analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling) and those used for their testing. Canonical and classificatory (linear, quadratic, and the non-parametric k nearest neighbours) discriminant analyses are applicable for testing hypotheses. Stepwise discriminant analysis aims to selects a set of the most useful discriminating characters. 
  The philosophy of the package is described in Å lenker et al. (in prep).
